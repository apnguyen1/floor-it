Project Status (Aidan):

Goals for the week:

- Make more categories
- Clean up the backend as it's somewhat messy at the moment
- Start pivoting to frontend as there is much more left to do there

Progress and issues:

- Working on creating more categories, making one for arknights operators is more work
  than expected since the APIs are hard to use
- Still need to clean up backend (add tests, reformat code to catch up on technical
  debt)
- DIdn't get a chance to start working on frontend but will likely do it since new
  tickets involve backend frontend integration
  Goals for next week:
- Finish ticket to add confidence level to backend DTO and change frontend to use it
- Complete ticket to not update existing category JSONs when running the script to add
  new JSONs

Project Status (Arman):

Goals for the week:

My goals for the week is to make the numbersdto generic for all categories as well as
potentially a generic script so that we don’t have to create a separate dto and script
for each

Progress and issues:

No issues at the moment but I’m still working on it I’ve had a pretty busy week so I
haven’t been able to finish it yet.

Goals for next week:
Hopefully finish up the tickets I’m working on and then start to help creating more
categories for people to play.

git # Project Status/Meeting Agenda:
## Goals for the week:
- Build out the pages for frontend (Home screen/about, category select, main game screen)
- Build the APIs in the backend for frontend to call (Retrieving a list of all categories, retrieving a associative array of images to words for a given category)
## Progress and issues:
- Fleshed out frontend designs for each page in detail, discussed and came to a consensus about how each page should look in relation to each other (i.e color scheme)
- Discussed the backend design and the explicit definitions of the APIs as well as the DTOs being used
## Goals for next week:
- Define and build the APIs for frontend to call
- Build each webpage
# Project Status (Aidan):
## Goals for the week:
- Build the API for frontend to call that returns a list of all categories along with an associated image url for each one
- Learn Kotlin and figure out what all the files in backend are doing
## Progress and issues:
- Learned some Kotlin and figured out what the files in the backend were doing (but now we're using python instead and CDNs instead of REST APIs)
- Made an API to fetch category data for an arknights operator trivia category
- Inexperienced in python and using CDNs so will need to learn before making much progress
- Since backend was changing didn't manage to add an API endpoint for a list of all categories yet
## Goals for next week:
- Learn the new python backend
- Define the DTOs we are using and define and code the APIs frontend will call (get categories, get category data)
- Learn about how to put json files on firebase
- Create code to turn data from manual input/APIs into jsons we can store on firebase

\# Project Status (Overall):

\---

\#\# Goals for the week:

\- Define and build the APIs for frontend to call  
\- Build each webpage

\#\# Progress and issues:

\[WRITE HERE\]

\#\# Goals for next week:

\-Finish designing the pipeline from API/data file to serializing category data jsons hosted on firebase that frontend can get, as well as the category preview list json

—

\# Meeting Agenda:

\- Present functioning backend that takes in urls or static text files then creates category data jsons frontend can fetch (hopefully)

\# Project Status (Aidan):

\#\# Goals for the week:

\- Learn the new python backend  
\- Define the DTOs we are using and define and code the APIs frontend will call (get categories, get category data)  
\- Learn about how to put json files on firebase  
\- Create code to turn data from manual input/APIs into jsons we can store on firebase

\#\# Progress and issues:

\- Being busy with other classes meant I didn't spend enough time working on my goals for this week, and not proactively communicating that meant people were blocked more than they needed to be  
\- Learned how the python backend works and defined the DTOs  
\- Andrew is handling the firebase CDN hosting so I didn't work on coding the APIs or anything like that  
\- Currently working on the code to turn data from dictionaries into exported json files

\#\# Goals for next week:

\- Finish setting up the structure to define models for categories then quickly serialize them into CategoryDataDTO jsons to be served to frontend  
\- Create a function that can automatically create a category preview json by scanning all the existing jsons  
\- Start looking into how we can create aliases for the answers

\# Project Status (Andrew):

\#\# Goals for the week:

Goal for the week is to finish the MVP and have a working game DEMO by thursday. Additionally refine the document to be more clear about the instruction and direction of the application

\#\# Progress and issues:

Close to creating a functional front game UI but a lot of work needed to create a aesthetic user UI experience

\#\# Goals for next week:

Deploying the game to firebase and getting the MVP refined for demo.

\# Project Status (Arman):

\#\# Goals for the week:

Working on the parser to get numbers and Bjj working (turned into useable json files) for the demo next week (will probably just end up being numbers that is actually shown but both will work)

\#\# Progress and issues:

I couldn’t complete the parser last week because I was bedridden with the flu :(

\#\# Goals for next week:

Working with Aiden and Andrew to make sure that the numbers category functions properly so it’ll display properly during our live demo next week.

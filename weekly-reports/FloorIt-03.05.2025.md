Project Status (Aidan):

Goals for the week:
- Finish ticket to add confidence level to backend DTO and change frontend to use it
- Complete ticket to not update existing category JSONs when running the script to add new JSONs

Progress and issues:
- Added confidence level to backend DTO, changed category class to use confidence level and serialize it into JSON
- Modified frontend to use confidence level from JSON instead of default value of 0.6
- Busy with other classes/clubs so have not had that much time to work this week
- Took longer than expected to get familiarized with frontend to use the confidence level
Goals for next week:
- Change script to leave already existing category JSONs untouched
- Add additional categories
